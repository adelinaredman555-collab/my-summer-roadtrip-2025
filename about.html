        <h1>All About me and My Trip</h1>
        <p>Some infomation about me is I'm a mother to my 7 month old son Kash,I was born in Kamloops, BC but from Standing Buffalo,Saskatchewan. Both my parents passed away when I was 12 and 21,both sides of my famil since that have supported/guided me throughout my life and I'm so grateful for all that they do for me.
        This roadtrip we took this August was very important for my family, we needed to go see our loved ones in Alberta and MAnitoba, but mostly importantly I need to go visit my cousin Larissa Bunn that passed away last year in late April of 2024 and was put to rest on her reserve Sagkeeng First Nation. The time she passed away I couldn't make out that way to her funeral in May of 2024, so this trip meant alot to go see her and see where she was on her reserve with my family. Especially to show her my baby and to know if she was alive today she would have loved Kash alots. </p>
