<hi/>

        <p>Some infomation about me is I'm a mother to my 7 month old son Kash,I was born in Kamloops, BC but from Standing Buffalo,Saskatchewan. Both my parents passed away when I was 12 and 21,both sides of my family since that has happened they have supported/guided me throughout my life and I'm so grateful for all that they do for me. I also went on to graduated high school in 2016 in High River, AB and later on Graduated from Native Education College with a Healthcare aide certificate in 2024.
        This roadtrip we took this August was very important for my family, we needed to go see our loved ones in Alberta and Manitoba, but mostly importantly I need to go visit my cousin Larissa Bunn that passed away last year in late April of 2024 and was put to rest on her reserve in Sagkeeng First Nation. The time she passed away I couldn't make out that way to her funeral in May of 2024, so this trip meant alot to go see her and see where she was on her reserve with my family. Especially to show her my baby and to know if she was alive today she would have loved Kash alots. 
        In the video above is pictures and videos of moments on our trip that were meaningful, the beginning of the video is clips of Kash and his Grandpa Ruben Bunn that works at Sagkeeng Nation Radio station as a Radio host. I linked the Radio station in this page, so feel free to checkout it, that was a really cool experience for me and the baby to see along with my cousin Tiearra. That was also a part of Larissa's daily life, the radio station and her dad, to go see that made it feel like i got to see and do things she enjoyed out in Manitoba wth the Bunn family and my family. </p>
