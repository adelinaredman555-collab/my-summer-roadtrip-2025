<hi/>
    <p>My name is Adelina Redman, and I’m a proud mother to my 7-month-old son, Kash. I was born in Kamloops, BC, and I'm from Standing Buffalo, Saskatchewan. I graduated from high school in High River, Alberta, and later earned my Healthcare Assistant Program Certificate from Native Education College in July 2024.

Both of my parents passed away—my mother when I was 12, and my father when I was 21. Despite these losses, I’ve been fortunate to receive incredible support and guidance from my aunts and cousins on both sides of my family. I’m deeply grateful for the love and strength they’ve shown me throughout my journey. </p>

                <h2>A Special Road Trip – August 2024</h2>

                <p>In August this year, my family took a road trip that was incredibly significant and meaningful to us. We traveled across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba to visit our loved ones—but most importantly, to visit the resting place of my cousin, Larissa Bunn, on her home reserve in Sagkeeng, Manitoba.
                    When Larissa passed away in May 2024, I wasn’t able to attend her funeral from Vancouver. So being able to make this trip meant a lot. Visiting her grave, checking in on her family, and paying my respects in person was an emotional but healing experience.
                    It was also important for me to bring my baby boy, Kash, to meet more of his family. Watching him bond with his Grandpa Ruben Bunn and the rest of the Bunn family was such a beautiful and powerful moment—one that I will always cherish.</p>
