        <p>This summer I went on a roadtrip with my family, we traveled from Vancouver,B.C all the way out to Winnipeg, MB and back to Vancouver, all in span in of two weeks.Along the way to Saskatchewan, my aunt Patricia and niece went to go get my cousin Tiearra from the U.S.A in Montana to come out and see family she hasn't seen at the Standing Buffalo {Tata룖a Naji Dak칩ta Oy치te} Powwow. We took so many photos and videos on this trip and I'm hoping I get to share all the beautiful moments we had on these trip with my family.</p>
